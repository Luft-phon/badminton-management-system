## 🌐  What is this website?
The Badminton Court Booking application is an online court reservation system designed for both users and court staff. Users can register, log in, view available time slots, book courts, and track their booking history. Each successful booking earns users reward points (EXP), which can be used for ranking or special offers. The system implements role-based access control: Members can book courts, while Staff manage bookings and court statuses, including confirming, canceling, or completing reservations. The application is built using ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework, and JWT for authentication, with ReactJS used for the front-end interface—delivering a fast, accurate, and convenient court booking experience.
